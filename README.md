# How to Obtain a D-U-N-S Number for Apple Developer Program Enrollment

## Understanding the D-U-N-S Number

The D-U-N-S Number is a unique nine-digit identifier assigned by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) to business entities on a location-specific basis. It is widely used as a standard business identifier and is crucial for joining the Apple Developer Program or the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. The D-U-N-S Number is utilized to verify the identity and legal entity status during the enrollment process.

## Eligibility Criteria

To receive a D-U-N-S Number, your business must be recognized as a legal entity, such as a corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company. DBAs, fictitious businesses, trade names, and branches are not accepted. Companies and educational institutions must provide a D-U-N-S Number registered to their legal entity. Government organizations have the option to enroll without a D-U-N-S Number, and individual enrollment does not require this identifier.

## Check for Existing D-U-N-S Number

Before proceeding, check if your organization already has a D-U-N-S Number assigned by Dun & Bradstreet. If not, you can submit your information to obtain a free D-U-N-S Number. Provide details such as legal entity name, headquarters address, mailing address, and work contact information.
